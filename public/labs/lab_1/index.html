<h2>Inline Elements</h2>

<p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
phrase.</p>
<p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
    of a word or phrase.</p>

<p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

<p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS
soon.</p>


<p>This example is about links and <a href='images.html'>images</a>.</p>

<p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Absolute links, like to
        <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
           target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good
           resource for web developers.</li>

        <li>Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras
            page</a>.</li>

            <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website,
                but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
</ul>

<p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may also be
    interested in <a href='../links.html'>links</a> or <a
    href='../images.html'>images</a>.</p>



    <p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for <a
        href='links.html'>links</a> and <a href='misc/extras.html'>useful
        extras</a>.</p>
     
     <h2>JPGs</h2>
     
     <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>
     
     <img src='images/mochi.jpg' width='75'/>

     <img src='images/mochi.jpg' width='75' alt='A mochi ball in a bubble'/>


     <h2>GIFs</h2>

     <p>GIFs are good for animations.</p>
     
     <img src='images/mochi.gif' width='75'/>




     <h2>PNGs</h2>

     <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</p>
     
     <img src='images/mochi.png' width='75'/>



     <h2>SVGs</h2>

     <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can.</p>
     
     <img src='images/mochi.svg' width='75'/>

First, the basics.

Alex Heading 1

Headings set your default page size

Add your four mochi images from your tutorial here. 

Lists

Let's make an unordered list.

Add an unordered list element
nest each item inside the unordered list in a list tag
List elements can be in any order

And now, one in order.

Add an ordered list element.
Add your top five music albums in order to the list.
Check it out, numbers by default.

Inline elements

Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Sometimes you want to do both.

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.

Add a hard line under here.

This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.
